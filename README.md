# E-Commerce Domain RFM Analysis

## Overview
This project implements a **Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) analysis** to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to provide actionable insights for improving customer engagement and loyalty strategies in the e-commerce domain.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and structured customer purchase data for analysis.
- **RFM Calculation**: Computed Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Assigned customers to loyalty levels (*Platinum*, *Diamond*, *Gold*, *Silver*) based on RFM scores.
- **Visualization**: Created plots to analyze customer distribution across segments.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Customer purchase details such as `CustomerID`, `InvoiceNo`, `Date of Purchase`, `Quantity`, `Price per Unit`, and `Shipping Location`.
- Derived columns for RFM analysis: `Recency`, `Frequency`, `Monetary`.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce-rfm-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd e-commerce-rfm-analysis
   ```
3. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook E-Commerce-Domain-RFM-Approach.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, calculate RFM scores, and visualize results.

## Results
The analysis outputs:
- RFM scores for each customer.
- Segmentation into loyalty levels based on RFM values.
- Insights into customer behavior for targeted marketing strategies.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical representation of results.
